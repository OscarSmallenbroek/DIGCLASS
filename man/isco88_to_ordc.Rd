\title{Translate 4-digit ISCO88 to ORDC}
\usage{
isco88_to_ordc(x, income = NULL, label = FALSE, to_factor = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of 4-digit ISCO codes.}

\item{income}{A numeric vector with the income corresponding to each respondent. See the details section for more information on how this is used.}

\item{label}{A logical value indicating whether to return the labels of the translated ORDC codes (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{to_factor}{A logical value indicating whether to return a factor instead of a character. The order of the labels is taken from the labels for ORDC found in \code{all_labels} (default is \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A character vector of ORDC codes.
}
\description{
This function translates a vector of 4-digit ISCO88 codes to ORDC codes using the translation table stored in \code{all_schema$isco88_to_ordc}. ORDC stands for Oslo Register Data Class.
}
\details{
The translation implemented in this function comes from the tables found in \url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00031224211020012/suppl_file/sj-pdf-1-asr-10.1177_00031224211020012.pdf}. That table is the appendix of the paper "Wealth Accumulation and Opportunity Hoarding: Class-Origin Wealth Gaps over a Quarter of a Century in a Scandinavian Country" from Nordli and Toft.

If \code{income} is specified, occupations in the economic upper class, the economic upper-middle class and the economic lower-middle class are grouped according to their income. The top 10 percent are assigned to the upper class, the next 40 percent to the upper-middle class, and the lowest 50 percent of earners to the lower-middle class. If income is not specified, a direct match to the ORDC class schema is performed.
