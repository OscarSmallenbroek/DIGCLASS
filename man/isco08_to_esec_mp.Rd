\title{Translate 3-digit ISCO08 to ESEC-MP}
\usage{
isco08_to_esec_mp(x, is_supervisor, self_employed, n_employees, label = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of 3-digit ISCO08 codes. Even though these should be 3-digit, instead of 130, the code should be 1300, which is the 3-digit version of ISCO.}

\item{is_supervisor}{A numeric vector indicating whether each individual is a supervisor (1, e.g. responsible for other employees) or not (0).}

\item{self_employed}{A numeric vector indicating whether each individual is self-employed (1) or not (0).}

\item{n_employees}{A numeric vector indicating the number of employees for each individual.}

\item{label}{A logical value indicating whether to return the labels of the translated ESEC-MP codes (default is \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A character vector of ESEC-MP codes.
}
\description{
This function translates a vector of 3-digit ISCO08 codes to ESEC-MP codes. ESEC-MP is a class schema similar to ESEC but reassigns managers and professionals (ISCO08 codes 1 and 2) to have both high/low managers and profesionals.
}
\details{
The \code{MP} in \code{ESEC-MP}stands for Managers and Professionals. The logic used to build this is like this:
\itemize{
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 1 and ISCO 1-digit 0 or 1 or has subordinates, \strong{is a high manager}
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 1 and is self-employed with more than 1 employee, \strong{is a high manager}
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 1 and has a 1-digit ISCO higher than 1 and is either an employee or a self-employed with no subordinates, is a \strong{high professional}
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 2 and ISCO 1-digit 0 or 1 or has subordinates, is a \strong{lower manager}
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 2 and is self-employed with more than 1 employee, is a \strong{lower manager}
\item All occupations with ESEC digit 2 and has a 1-digit ISCO higher than 1 and is either an employee or a self-employed with no subordinates, is a \strong{lower professional}
}

This translation was created from the Stata do file shared by Oscar Smallenbroek called "ESEC-MP.do". For more info, please contact the author.

This function will accept 3-digit codes as 4 digits. This means that if the 3-digit code is 131 then it should be 1310. All codes should be 4 digits, even though the code is represented as 3 digits (1310, 1230, etc..)
